		<h3><u>Major</u></h3>
		<p>This will be my third year of studying for my degree in computer science.</p>
		<h3><u>Comfort with Web Development</u></h3>

		<h3><u>Learning Goals</u></h3>
		<p>I am taking this class in order to better understand the architecture of a modern website and learn how to implelment those same principles in my own web projects. I have a basic understanding of html and css but have yet to implement javascript in my websites. The backend server architecutre is the section of this class that is of greatest interest to me as it is the thing I know the least about. By the end of this class I want to be able to host a personal blog at this address in order to publish the projects that I have already completed and are currently working on to the world.</p>

		<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
		<p>At the beginning of this last summer I got my first job within my field. I was hired as a computational research assistant for the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing. Over the course of the summer I worked on implementing a new online teaching platform for the deparment to make it easier for the biology students to learn how to code and use linux for their data analysis. I structured a system based around docker containers that host both a Jupyter server and an RStudio server for each class in order to isolate each class from over stepping their resource allotments. I hope to use what I learn from this class to create a better landing page for this project as well because I only had my limited knowledge of css and html to create it at first.
