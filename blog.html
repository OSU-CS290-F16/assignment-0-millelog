		<h3>Assignment 1 : Basic HTML </h3>
		<h4 align="right"><em>September 26th, 2016</em></h4>
		<p>The biggest challenge with this assignment for me was probably getting the picture of me in a location that was readable by the html. This was solved relatively easily by downloading the picture locally and using scp to get it from my ubuntu laptop to the flip server. It took until after I had gotten this all setup to realize that I could've just used a different image hosting service and linked to that through the html. I had gotten too used to the habit of hosting all of my own images due to work, and while a little more difficult to setup I believe it is still the better practice in order to maintain website congruency. I was able to complete this assignment using only references to the notes from class for the syntax of beginning an html page.</p>
